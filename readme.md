#Java Diff

Determines the number of diffs between two well formatted java files. The contents of both files are displayed side by side and the number of diffs are shown below. Type of diffs including added, removed, and changed lines of code are counted as well.

`/dist/lineCounter.jar` is a packaged version of the application. A file chooser is prompted for the two files. Example java files can be found in `dist/examples/`.
